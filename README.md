## About the App

* This is a simple app wich allows you to find and view gifs.
* We use the Gify API for sourcing our gifs.
* you can create your own gif search buttons by typing in the input field and and pressing the **Submit Button**.
* When you click a gifs button it will clear out the previous gifs and display 10 gifs associated with the clicked button.


## Other features I could add but havn't yet

* I could make a favorites section where you can save your favorite gifs.
* I could allow the user to increase the search results.
* Include a 1-click download button for each gif, this should work across device types.

**Notes** I used mostly `<div>` elements in the html of this project.
